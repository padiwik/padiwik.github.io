Are you stuck on a puzzle? This page is a spiritual successor to Have You Tried (which I've found rather useless), fueled by real experience from puzzlehunts I've done.

* Starting
  * Google the puzzle title
  * Read first letter of all the clues
    * or all capitalized flavortext words

* Some mechanics to try
  * Codes
    * Baudot cipher
    * Braille by number of dots
    * Foreign writing scripts
    * Mayan numerals (base 5)
  * Numbers
    * ASCII
    * Factoring
    * Phone area codes
    * Tracing on a numpad
  * Crosswords
    * Cells are different across and down
    * Cells have multiple letters
  * General
    * Cocktails
    * Darts
    * Trace a picture in order

* Extract
  * Add or remove a letter
  * Final answer will be the completion of a phrase, not the entire phrase
  * Index (into first part of a clue's solution, usually)
  * Perhaps a shared property of the words is an artifact of the mechanic, rather than the relevant extract
  * Pronounce it!
  * Rearrange stuff into a nice shape
  * Take thematic substrings (especially with metas)
  * Use "numerical" things just as an ordering

* It isn't working?
  * Check mistakes from the first values you filled
  * Don't forget "a" is a word
  * Maybe if it isn't being hinted, the mechanic is just trivially dumb
